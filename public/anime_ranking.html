<h1>The Best Animes According to Nodirbek</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Animes of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>One Piece right now is on going. I like this anime because of Luffy wants to be The King of The Pirates and he has another level of Motivation to achive his goal.</p>
<h3>One-Punch Man</h3>
<p>There's have a superhero named Saitama. He is very simple and funny. He will win any stronger monster with one PUNCH.</p>
<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>Layt Yegami is the smart person in this anime. I like this anime because when I watched it I understand logical thinking very useful.</p>
